# ARCOS

ARCOS is a recursive cognitive architecture designed to support human–AI alignment, reflective reasoning, and system-level thinking.

It is not a chatbot, a productivity tool, or a fixed framework.

ARCOS functions as a *thinking architecture* — a way of structuring interaction, reflection, and iteration between a human and an intelligent system so that meaning, intent, and alignment remain intact as complexity increases.

## Core ideas

- **Recursion over automation**  
  ARCOS prioritizes reflective loops over blind execution. Each output is treated as input for higher-order evaluation.

- **Human-in-the-loop by design**  
  The system assumes that human judgment, values, and context are essential — not optional.

- **Alignment through structure, not control**  
  Rather than constraining intelligence, ARCOS shapes the *conditions* under which reasoning occurs.

- **Living architecture**  
  ARCOS is intentionally unfinished. It evolves through use, observation, and revision.

## What ARCOS is not

- Not an AI agent that acts autonomously
- Not a prompt library or workflow tool
- Not a claim of AGI

ARCOS is an architectural approach to *thinking with* intelligence rather than delegating thought to it.

## Status

ARCOS is a public, evolving system.
This repository documents its structure, principles, and iterations over time.

Further modules, notes, and versions will be added as the architecture develops.
