# Architecture

This directory documents the internal structure of ARCOS as a cognitive architecture.

Rather than defining a fixed system, these documents describe:
- How reasoning is structured
- How reflection is layered
- How alignment is preserved as complexity increases

Each file in this directory represents a **structural component**, not an implementation.

The architecture is expected to evolve.
