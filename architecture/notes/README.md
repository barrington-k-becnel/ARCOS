# Notes

This directory contains exploratory thinking, reflections, and working notes related to ARCOS.

These documents are intentionally informal and iterative.
They capture ideas in motion rather than finalized structure.

Notes may include:
- Observations from real usage
- Conceptual sketches
- Open questions
- Early formulations of architectural ideas

Some notes may later graduate into formal architecture or versioned releases.
