# Versions

This directory tracks the formal evolution of ARCOS over time.

Each version represents a stable snapshot of the architecture’s guiding principles, assumptions, and structure at a given moment.

Versioning is used to:
- Capture conceptual milestones
- Preserve prior thinking without overwriting it
- Make architectural change explicit and inspectable

Earlier versions are not considered obsolete — they remain reference points for understanding ARCOS’s development.
