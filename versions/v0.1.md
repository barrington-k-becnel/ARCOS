# ARCOS v0.1 — Foundational Architecture

**Status:** Initial formal snapshot  
**Date:** 2025-12-16  

## Purpose

This document captures the first stable articulation of ARCOS as a
recursive cognitive architecture for human–AI alignment and reflective reasoning.

ARCOS is not a product, agent, or workflow.
It is a *thinking architecture* — a structure that preserves meaning,
intent, and alignment as cognitive complexity increases.

## Core Principles

1. **Recursion over automation**  
   Every output is treated as input for higher-order evaluation.
   Reflection precedes execution.

2. **Human-in-the-loop by design**  
   Human judgment, values, and context are essential — not optional.

3. **Alignment through structure, not control**  
   ARCOS shapes the conditions under which reasoning occurs,
   rather than constraining intelligence directly.

4. **Living architecture**  
   ARCOS is intentionally unfinished.
   It evolves through use, observation, and revision.

## What ARCOS Is Not

- Not an autonomous AI agent  
- Not a prompt library  
- Not a productivity tool  
- Not a fixed framework  

## Notes

This version establishes conceptual boundaries and guiding principles.
Future versions may expand structure, terminology, and formalism,
but this foundation remains a reference point.
